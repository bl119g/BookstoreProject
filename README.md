IS448 (Markup &amp; Scripting Languages) @ UMBC Final Project

A rough cut for my final, but hoping to utilize React to fix things up after this class is over!
Currently utilizes: HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP/SQL

Creates a admin and client side:

Admin: Login page
       Add/Edit/Delete Books, Comments, Categories, Contact
       
Client: Displays contents added on Admin side
        Can add anonymous comments that are reviewed and approved on client side
